  <h2>First Paragraph</h2>
  <p class="paragraphs">This is the first paragraph of this document. We will apply some type of style to this paragraph that is not applied in the next paragraph. Gonna be crazy. Absolutely loopy.<a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/html-css-javascript-for-web-developers/lecture/jI4A3/lecture-13-element-class-and-id-selectors">Link with styling</a></p>
  <h2>Second Paragraph</h2>
  <p>If I have done this correctly, paragraph two will be of a different style than paragraph one, because it has a different CSS class. <span id="mainPoint">I don't like how class is used in CSS,</span> it's confusing with Java.</p>
  <footer>This footer should have the same styling as h1</footer>
